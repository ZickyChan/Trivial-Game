# Trivial-Game
### What is the application?
* This is my second assignment for Programming 1 course of RMIT Vietnam. 
* This app is programmed in java. 
* This is a small game which players have to type the answer of the given question. There are 6 topics for players to choose. Each topic has 3 questions.
* The players will have only a brain at the beginning of the game. Players can earn brains by passing a topic. Players can have maximum 3 brains.
* If players answer a question wrong, they will lose a brain. If they have no brains, they will lose the game.

### How to set up the application?
* To set up the application, you have to make sure there is a file called **derbyclient.jar** in the folder **./dist/lib**. If you miss the file while extracting the zip file, you have to download it seperately.
* Then you have to visit SQL file folder, open the **readme.txt** and follow the instruction there to get the game ready.
* Don't forget to **_run the server file_** before running the game.

### What features is used?
* I used the Javax JPanel, JComponent to help me build the game. 
* The game also have the sound effect.
* The game is a OOP program.
